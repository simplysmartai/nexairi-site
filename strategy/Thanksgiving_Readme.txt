# Nexairi Thanksgiving Series – GitHub + n8n Automation README

## 0. Purpose

This project sets up the **Nexairi Thanksgiving Series**: eight Thanksgiving-themed blog posts automatically created and published over the 8 days leading into Thanksgiving.

Stack:

- **Content storage:** GitHub repo (markdown/MDX files)
- **Hosting:** Cloud-based static site (deployed from GitHub)
- **Automation:** n8n + Codex/AI agents + web search
- **Theme:** Calm, human, “AI quietly helping in the background while you live your life.”

The goal is that **AI handles everything** (topics, recipes, text, images, and commits) while the site owner travels with family.

## 1. Content Model & File Locations

> IMPORTANT: Do **not** break existing folder structure.
> 
> - If these paths differ from the actual repo, Codex must:
>   - Detect the existing content folder (e.g. `/content`, `/src/content`, `/posts`).
>   - Mirror the structure under that root instead of creating duplicates.

### 1.1 Recommended layout

Under your repo root:

- `automation/thanksgiving/`
  - `config/`
    - `thanksgiving_series_config.json`
  - `prompts/`
    - `thanksgiving_writer_prompt.txt`
  - `content_queue/`  
    *(drafts AI will generate here before commit, useful for local testing)*  
    - `day_01_sides.md`
    - `day_02_soups.md`
    - `day_03_desserts.md`
    - `day_04_turkey_planning.md`
    - `day_05_turkey_recipes_alt_mains.md`
    - `day_06_make_ahead.md`
    - `day_07_thanksgiving_game_plan.md`
    - `day_08_what_to_do_on_thanksgiving.md`
  - `logs/`
    - `thanksgiving_series_log.md`
  - `n8n/`
    - `flow_notes.md`  *(human-readable description of the n8n flow)*

Actual **live blog posts** should live in your existing blog folder, e.g.:

- `content/blog/` or `src/content/blog/` or `posts/`

For this series, Codex should create files like:

- `content/blog/2025-11-19-signature-sides.md`
- `content/blog/2025-11-20-cozy-soups.md`
- etc.

The exact path is configurable via `thanksgiving_series_config.json`.

## 2. Front Matter Format

Assume standard markdown with YAML front matter (adjust keys to your static site generator).

Example for a generated post:

```markdown
