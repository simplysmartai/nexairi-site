# Nexairi Editorial Style Guide

Purpose: make every article clear, factual, and consistent with Nexairi.

Voice & rhythm
- Present tense, active voice. 8–18 word sentences by default.
- Lead with the outcome; support with steps and evidence.
- Use subheads every 120–200 words. One idea per paragraph.
- Bullets beat walls of text. Favor lists and short blocks.

Formatting
- H1 once (the title). H2 for sections, H3 for sub‑sections.
- Bold for key actions/labels; italics sparingly for emphasis.
- Link text is descriptive (no “click here”).
- Include image_prompt text under the first figure for thumbnail generation.

Sourcing
- Prefer primary sources and reputable outlets. Cite 2–4 sources for longform.
- Numbers require a citation (inline link or citations list at end).
- If a fact is uncertain, remove or qualify it.

SEO
- Title ≤ 70 chars; meta description 150–160 chars.
- Use target keyword in title, H2, and first 100 words; include 4–6 semantically related phrases.
- Internal links: 2–4 links to relevant Nexairi posts (see /data/internal_links.json).

Accessibility
- Alt text describes function/context, not “image of…”.
- Avoid color‑only meaning. Keep contrast ≥ AA.
- Write numbers and times clearly (e.g., “10–15 minutes”).

Structure (longform)
1) Lede (2–3 sentences)
2) Nut graph (what the reader gets)
3) 5–7 sections with actionable steps
4) Callouts/checklists where helpful
5) Summary + “verify or next step” links
