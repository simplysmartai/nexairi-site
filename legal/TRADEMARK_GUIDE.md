# Trademark & Brand References

Nominative fair use only:
- Use brand names solely to identify the product/service (no logos).
- Do not imply endorsement/sponsorship/affiliation.
- Use generic descriptors where possible ("wireless earbuds" vs specific brand).

Logos & UI
- Avoid logos in images. Blur/redraw if unavoidable.
- UI screenshots that display marks should be cropped or replaced.

Disclaimers
- If brand comparisons are made: include a neutral disclaimer ("Brands are property of their owners; no affiliation implied").
