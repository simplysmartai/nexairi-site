Holiday weeks compress guests, bags, schedules, and expectations into small spaces. The best technology for these weeks doesn’t feel flashy—it removes friction quietly. Here’s a brand‑agnostic checklist that works in apartments or houses.

## Connectivity: stable first, then fast

- **Guest Wi‑Fi:** Create or enable a guest network with a simple name and posted QR code. Keep your main devices on the private SSID.
- **Router placement:** Center of the home, off the floor, away from metal. Reboot 24 hours before guests arrive.
- **Mesh or extender:** If you have dead zones, a single mesh node near guest rooms solves most “I can’t connect” complaints.

## Power and charging: the bottleneck killer

- **Two power stations:** One in the living area, one in the guest room, each with AC + USB‑C + USB‑A. Label cables by type/length.
- **Travel strip + cube:** A short, grounded extension plus a compact cube solves hotel/older home outlet scarcity.
- **Cable caddy:** A small pouch with spare cables, wall brick, and a 6‑foot USB‑C saves hours of scavenging.

## Light and noise: comfort without cost

- **Warm white lamps** on smart plugs or timers: turn on at sunset, off at midnight. Calm lighting beats overhead glare.
- **Nightlights** in hallways and bathrooms: prevent stumbles, especially with kids/elders.
- **White‑noise** via phone apps or a compact machine near guest rooms; it buys everyone privacy.

## Kitchen flow: heat, hold, and signal

- **Probe thermometer** ends turkey guesswork; set alerts at 160°F breast.
- **Electric kettle** for tea/hot drinks; keeps the stove free.
- **Label maker or painter’s tape** to mark leftovers, allergens, and “hands off” items.

## Travel kits that travel well

- **Battery pack** (10–20k mAh), dual‑port fast charger, earbuds with passive isolation, compact umbrella, microfiber towel.
- **Docs pouch:** ID, cards, insurance, a pen, and a few blank index cards for instructions/labels.

## Safety and privacy, lightly

- **Smart lock codes** for guests (time‑bound). Revoke after departure.
- **Cameras off in private areas** while guests stay. If you keep an exterior camera, disclose it.
- **Disable voice purchase** on smart speakers. Keep microphones muted in bedrooms.

## Quick automations (optional)

- **“Arrive” scene:** Lamps + soft music when a phone arrives on the home Wi‑Fi.
- **“Goodnight” scene:** Lamps off, porch on, thermostat to eco.

## Backup mindset

- **Spare hotspot** (phone or dedicated) if ISP blips.
- **Spare HDMI cable** for impromptu movie nights.
- **Spare earbuds** for late‑night calls.

Tech should make the week feel calmer, not busier. Start with connectivity and power, add soft lighting and noise control, and keep privacy in mind. Everything else is optional.
