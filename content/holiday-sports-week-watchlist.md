Holiday sports are about two things: meaningful games and shared screens. This guide hits both—what matters across leagues and how to keep it fun when the living room gets crowded.

## NFL: Thanksgiving, rivalry, and playoff math

- **Thanksgiving slate:** Traditional hosts + prime time cap. Look for playoff implication games and QB health updates that swing lines.
- **Wild‑card race:** Focus on conference tiebreakers; head‑to‑head and division records matter more now.

## College Football: rivalry week + title slots

- **Rivalry weekend:** Conference title berths and CFP positioning often hinge here. Check injury reports and away‑field weather.
- **Watch windows:** Noon ET rivalries, mid‑afternoon ranked clashes, and a prime‑time heavyweight. Pace your snacks.

## NBA: early form checks

- **Contenders’ rotations:** Holiday week can preview playoff rotations as coaches tighten benches in marquee games.
- **Rising players:** Track second‑year leaps and veterans on new teams in national TV slots.

## NHL: road trips and goaltending

- **Goaltender back‑to‑backs:** Holiday travel affects starts. Hot hands vs. rest decisions can tilt outcomes.
- **Special teams:** Early season PK/PP trends stabilize by this stretch—good barometers in tight games.

## MLS / International

- **MLS Cup playoffs** timing varies; check fixtures if your club is alive.
- **International friendlies/tournaments** can pop up; streaming services post schedules late—double check day‑of.

## How to watch sanely with family

- **Pick two priority windows.** Announce them early, share the TV plan, and stick to it.
- **Second‑screen quietly.** Use captions; keep volume reasonable.
- **Make it social:** prop cards, squares, or a simple “first to three moments” bingo keeps casual viewers in.

## Setup checklist

- Internet stable (reboot router day‑before), streaming logins verified, spare HDMI cable, remote batteries, captions on by default, and a soft throw on every seat.

Enjoy the games—and the company. The wins are sweeter when the room’s happy too.
