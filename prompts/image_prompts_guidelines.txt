Image Prompt Guidelines (for free/stock or generative tools)
- Subject first, then setting, then lighting, then style.
- Avoid brand logos and identifiable people.
- Prefer natural light, documentary/editorial styles; minimal props.
- Thumbnails: uncluttered subject, strong silhouette, warm tone for lifestyle; neutral for tech.
Examples
- "Cozy living room at dusk, candles and linen table, soft throws, natural window light, editorial 35mm"
- "Carry-on and personal bag on bench, headphones and passport, soft window light, documentary"
