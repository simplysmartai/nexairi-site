Quick Takeaways
- Base yourself near Karasuma Oike Station for frictionless access to both Hankyu and Subway lines; everything in this guide radiates from that node.
- Buy the ICOCA IC card at Kansai Airport for tap-in rides on JR, Hankyu, Keihan, and city buses—no more ticket machines.
- Book World Heritage sites (Katsura Imperial Villa, Saiho-ji moss temple) at least three weeks out; slots fill fast.
- Pack compression socks and a collapsible umbrella; Kyoto’s humidity and sudden showers are real even in November shoulder season.
- Respect quiet hours: residential alleys request no loud conversation after 9 pm.

Arrival and Orientation (Friday)
Kansai International Airport (KIX) to Kyoto Station takes 75 minutes on the JR Haruka Limited Express. Reserve seats online or via ticket machine; cost is roughly ¥4,600 one way with ICOCA & Haruka package. Once at Kyoto Station, switch to the Karasuma Subway Line two stops to Karasuma Oike. Hotels like Ace Kyoto, The General Kyoto Takatsuji Fuyacho, or Citadines Karasuma-Gojo sit within a 10-minute walk and offer design-forward interiors plus coin laundry. Drop bags, grab a conbini onigiri, and sync your devices to hotel Wi-Fi. Pro tip: buy a Kyoto City Bus & Subway One-Day Pass (¥1,200) if you anticipate three or more rides in a day; otherwise tap with ICOCA.

Day 1 Morning: Eastern Kyoto Circuit
07:00 — Sunrise at Nanzen-ji’s Sanmon Gate. The grounds open 24/7 and the stair climb unveils Higashiyama views worth the early alarm. Photographers: keep tripods collapsed; temple staff only allow them during special sessions.
07:45 — Walk 10 minutes to Keage Incline, the disused railway with cherry trees. Shoulder season still brings rust reds and golds across the canal; it’s less crowded than peak sakura weeks.
08:15 — Coffee at % Arabica Higashiyama. Expect a short queue; baristas pull single-origin espresso in Slayer machines while you peer at Yasaka Pagoda. Grab an iced latte and a matcha croissant.
09:00 — Philosopher’s Path stroll heading north toward Honen-in. Along the canal, stop at Koto-in for its asymmetrical moss garden—architects love its framing lessons.
10:15 — Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion). Entry ¥500. Follow the one-way loop and note the Ginshadan (raked sand) geometry, a lesson in wabi-sabi minimalism.
Accessibility note: Paths here include gentle slopes; wheelchairs can navigate most areas but the upper viewpoint requires stairs.

Day 1 Lunch + Afternoon: Craft and Contrast
12:00 — Lunch at Omen Ginkaku-ji. Order the signature udon with vegetable tempura; they present condiments like edible art.
13:30 — Cab or ride-share (DiDi works) to Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art. Current exhibitions often pair modern Japanese graphic designers with global counterparts. Tickets ¥2,000 average.
15:30 — Hop on the Tozai Line to Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae and walk to Pontocho Alley. Make a reservation at Kanga-an in advance if plant-based kaiseki appeals; it’s run by Buddhist monks.
16:45 — Golden Hour at Kiyomizu-dera. Use the Stage of Kiyomizu as your anchor; the wooden veranda juts out 13 meters without a single nail. Timed tickets during autumn illumination sell out, so secure them online. The Otowa waterfall still allows ladle sips—choose one of the three streams (longevity, success, love) but not all three; locals consider that greedy.
18:30 — Dinner at Guilo Guilo Hitoshina (eight-course kaiseki with playful plating). Reserve via hotel concierge; ¥5,000–6,000.
20:30 — Stroll the Kamogawa riverbank. Street musicians cluster near Sanjo Bridge; keep voices low after 21:00 per neighborhood requests.

Day 2 Morning: Arashiyama and Katsura
06:30 — Hankyu Kyoto Line from Karasuma to Katsura (15 minutes) then transfer to the Hankyu Arashiyama Line (7 minutes). Arrive before 07:00 to beat bamboo grove crowds.
07:05 — Arashiyama Bamboo Grove boardwalk. Stay on the central path to protect roots and keep tripods off the railings.
07:45 — Tenryu-ji Temple. ¥500 entry. Wander the Sogenchi Garden, originally designed in 1339 and now UNESCO-listed. Landscape architect Muso Soseki’s borrowed scenery technique frames Arashiyama’s mountains.
08:30 — Breakfast at % Arabica Arashiyama or Sagano Boulangerie. Grab melon pan and drip coffee.
09:15 — Katsura Imperial Villa tour. Reservations go through the Imperial Household Agency; passports required. The guided walk covers 1.3 km of gravel; wear supportive shoes. Designers adore the tatami proportions and moon-viewing platforms.
10:45 — Sagano Scenic Railway (Torokko) one-way ride back toward Kameoka. It’s a 25-minute open-air trip along the Hozugawa River; reserve Row A for unobstructed photos.

Day 2 Lunch + Afternoon: Urban Textures
12:30 — Return to central Kyoto. Lunch at Nishiki Market: try soy doughnuts from Konnamonja and dashimaki tamago skewers. Markets peak noon–14:00, so stay patient.
13:30 — Kyoto International Manga Museum near Karasuma Oike. Entry ¥900. Browse over 300,000 manga volumes and watch resident artists sketch live.
14:45 — Walk to D&Department Kyoto for slow retail therapy; the store curates prefectural craft objects and sustainable souvenirs. Ship breakables home via Yamato Transport rather than stuffing them in carry-ons.
16:00 — Tea at Ippodo. Order a flight comparing gyokuro and sencha to understand umami differences. Staff offer English explanations and brewing tips.
17:00 — Souvenir sprint: stock up on Kyo-yaki ceramics in the Teramachi shopping arcade; prices span ¥1,000 to ¥10,000 depending on glaze techniques.

Day 2 Evening: Contemporary Kyoto
18:00 — Dinner reservation at LURRA°. Chef Mark Panes serves a fire-focused tasting menu highlighting local farms. Expect ¥16,000 per person, prepaid via TableCheck.
20:30 — Cocktail at Bee’s Knees Speakeasy (look for the navy door). Order the Kyoto Mule featuring clarified ginger beer.
22:00 — Late-night sento (public bath) at Funaoka Onsen if you have tattoos you can cover with sleeves or patches; otherwise choose a tattoo-friendly private onsen like Kyaiktiyo.
