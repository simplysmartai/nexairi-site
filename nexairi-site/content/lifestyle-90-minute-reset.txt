Quick Takeaways
- Stack 20 minutes of daylight and mobility within 30 minutes of waking to anchor circadian rhythms per AASM guidance.
- Alternate 25-minute focus sprints with five-minute release drills to meet ACSM movement targets without feeling chained to a desk.
- Use a three-part plate (25 g protein / 40 g slow carbs / color-rich produce) at brunch to stabilize glucose through your second sprint window.
- Log an "energy delta" in Airtable daily so Luna + Eden can flag overwork patterns before burnout sets in.
- Reserve the last ten minutes of the 90 for "future proofing"—schedule one social touch, one admin task, and one experiment.

Section 1: Why 90 Minutes Works (and When to Stretch It)
Most creators we support already know the science: circadian rhythm anchors form in roughly 90-minute ultradian cycles, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine still recommends 7–9 hours of sleep for adults. The 90-minute reset simply mirrors that natural cadence. By giving yourself a single, well-defined block to warm up, fuel up, and focus, you protect the rest of the day for deep work or calls. If you habitually wake later, tack the block right after your first hydration and sunlight exposure. If you’re an early chronotype, push the block closer to mid-morning so you don’t collide with REM-heavy sleep. The rule: the block starts only after you’ve had five full minutes of daylight exposure (window light counts, but balcony is better). That light signals the suprachiasmatic nucleus—your body’s master clock—to release cortisol gently rather than in a spike, which keeps anxiety down. Even in winter, 1000 lux of light by a window is achievable with a 10,000-lux lamp placed 16–24 inches away.

Section 2: Mobility + Breath Circuit (Minutes 0–20)
The reset starts with movement, not email. ACSM’s guidance of 150 minutes moderate activity weekly sounds hefty until you realize 20 minutes daily already covers two thirds of it. Follow this sequence:
1. Hydrate: 350–500 ml of room-temp water with a pinch of mineral salt to replenish electrolytes after sleep.
2. Breath reset: four rounds of 4-2-4-2 box breathing to calm your parasympathetic system.
3. Mobility ladder (12 minutes):
   - Cat-cow x10, thoracic rotations x10 each side to open the spine.
   - 60 seconds of world’s greatest stretch alternating legs.
   - 90-second ankle and wrist CARs (controlled articular rotations) to prep joints for typing.
4. Tempo march: Choose jump rope, marching on the spot, or a light jog for five minutes gradually ramping heart rate to 60% max. You’re done when you feel warm, not exhausted.
Log any discomfort inside your Airtable or Notion tracker. Vera, our fact checker, recommends tagging recurring pain so we can suggest a posture tweak or refer you to a licensed pro if needed.

Section 3: Light Therapy, Planning, and Environment (Minutes 20–40)
Next, anchor your senses. Move to the brightest corner of your space or step outside. The goal is 10 minutes of direct daylight or 15 minutes beside a bright window paired with light therapy if your latitude sits above 40° in winter. While light does its work, skim your three priorities. Use this mini-agenda:
- Priority stack: one revenue move, one relationship move, one maintenance task.
- Project Kanban check: five-minute review to unblock collaborators.
- Workspace sweep: wipe down desk, refill water, open ventilation.
Iris (brand designer) asked us to normalize “micro-resets” for the workspace: align monitor height with your eyes, set color temperature to 5000–6500K for daylight tasks, and 2700K when sun sets. According to WELL Building Standard research, reducing glare and blue light in the evening can improve melatonin release by roughly 45 minutes earlier—a lifesaver for creators who struggle to wind down.

Section 4: Fuel and Supplement Stack (Minutes 40–55)
Breakfast or brunch? We lean on a 25/40/35 macro split: 25 grams protein, 40 grams low-glycemic carbs (steel-cut oats, quinoa, sprouted bread), 35 grams fiber-rich produce plus healthy fats. This plate gives you 20–25% of daily fiber intake (USDA recommends 25 g for women, 38 g for men) and stabilizes glucose for about three hours. A sample plate:
- Protein: two eggs plus 80 g smoked salmon (approx. 24 g protein).
- Carbs: 1/2 cup cooked quinoa with cinnamon.
- Produce: sautéed spinach, cherry tomatoes, half an avocado.
Add-ons: Vitamin D3 (especially October–March), 1000 mg omega-3 if you don’t eat fatty fish, and magnesium glycinate at night for muscle recovery. Always cross-check supplements with a licensed provider. Track how you feel 30 and 90 minutes post meal; note digestion, focus, and mood. Milo flags keywords like “fiber-rich breakfast” and “balanced plates” inside the copy so searchers looking for specific nutrition cues find us.

Section 5: Focus Sprints and Release Drills (Minutes 55–85)
Now you’re ready for the meat of the block: two 12-minute sprints separated by micro-breaks. Use a physical timer or Flow app to stay honest.
Sprint 1 (12 minutes): Choose the task with the highest leverage—drafting hooks, editing a reel, writing client emails. Noise-canceling headphones with brown-noise playlists lower cognitive load if you’re in a noisy apartment.
Release 1 (3 minutes): Stand up, roll shoulders, and perform 10 air squats or hip hinges. Swap with wall angels if you’re dressed for a meeting.
Sprint 2 (12 minutes): Shift to a complementary task: outlining, organizing files, prototyping. Keep the same doc open; context switching kills output.
Release 2 (3 minutes): Do a vision break. Focus on a point 20 feet away for 20 seconds to relax eye muscles per ophthalmology guidance.
Sprint 3 (10 minutes): Admin pass—update CRM, send invoices, schedule social posts. That admin move is what keeps your future self calm. Finish with two-minute journaling: “What restored me?” and “What still feels sticky?”

Section 6: Future-Proof Close (Minutes 85–90)
The final five minutes decide whether the reset sticks. Use this checklist:
- Schedule one 10-minute social touch (DM a collaborator, voice memo a friend).
- Book your next body maintenance block (stretch session, PT, therapy).
- Jot one experiment you’ll run today (new CTA, pricing tweak, creative format).
Rate your energy 1–5 and log it. Over 30 days, look for deltas. If your average dips below 3 for three days straight, that’s your cue to add an extra rest block or shift bedtime earlier. Helix also likes to know when your energy is low so ad commitments stay realistic.
