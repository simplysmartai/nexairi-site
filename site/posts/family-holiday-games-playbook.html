      <p>Games make the day feel like a holiday—even if the scoreboard doesn’t matter. Here are low‑friction options that need little gear, scale across ages, and fit in 20–40 minute windows.</p>

      <h2>Quick warm‑ups (5–10 min)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Circle toss: soft ball, increasing distance, points for clean catches; rotate partners.</li>
        <li>Shadow tag: pair up, mirror movements without tagging; switch leaders.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Backyard football (no bruises edition)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two‑hand touch, first downs every 2 cones, 5‑second “count” on rush, no blocking.</li>
        <li>Balance ages; rotate QBs; bonus point for a completion to every teammate.</li>
        <li>Field: 20–30 yards if space allows; cones or shoes as markers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Basketball shootout</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Around the world or knockout; set a “no hard fouls” rule and mix difficulty by distance.</li>
        <li>No hoop? Bank‑shot challenge with mini hoop or laundry basket indoors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pickleball / tennis lite</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Driveway net or tape line; foam balls for kids; first to 7 rally points.</li>
        <li>King/Queen of the Court rotation keeps everyone moving.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Indoors: tiny‑space winners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Balloon volleyball: sofa as the net; point only if the balloon lands.</li>
        <li>Cooperative challenge: build a card house in teams; tallest in 10 minutes wins.</li>
        <li>Dice fitness: roll two dice—reps × simple moves (squats, wall push‑ups, toe taps).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Relay ideas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Kitchen relay: carry a spoon with a grape across the room; tag next runner.</li>
        <li>Puzzle sprint: each teammate adds one piece to a 50‑piece puzzle before tagging out.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety and inclusive tweaks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Warm up gently (ankles, hips, shoulders).</li>
        <li>Use softer balls, clear boundaries, and time caps.</li>
        <li>Offer “coach roles” for grandparents or anyone sitting out: scorekeeping, music, referee.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Gear basket</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft football, mini soccer ball, cones, jump rope, balloons, foam paddles, deck of cards, small prizes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Set a timer, keep score loosely, and end with a team photo. The point is movement and laughter while the kitchen does its thing.</p>
