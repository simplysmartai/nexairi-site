      <p>Holiday traffic, sold‑out trains, full flights, surprise weather—it’s all predictable in the abstract and chaotic in the moment. This guide turns peak‑season unpredictability into a set of simple containers: timing, bags, documents, and contingencies. You’re not aiming for perfect; you’re aiming for uneventful.</p>

      <h2>The Three‑Container Rule (works for any mode)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Personal bag</strong> (never leaves you): ID/wallet, phone + battery, meds, chargers, a pen, earplugs, snacks, water bottle (empty at security), one warm layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Day bag</strong> (quick access): toiletries, sleep mask, wipes, spare shirt/socks, cables, compact first‑aid, small towel, Ziplocs, collapsible tote.</li>
        <li><strong>Hold bag</strong> (checked/trunk/overhead): clothes, gifts, shoes. If it’s mission‑critical, it goes in personal/day.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Timing that resists holiday chaos</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Depart off‑peak.</strong> On roads, leave early morning (before 7 a.m.) or late evening. For flights, first departures and midweek flights cancel least.</li>
        <li><strong>Add 50% buffer to normal transit time.</strong> If a drive is usually 6 hours, plan 9 with stops and weather. For flights, arrive 2.5–3 hours early and target long connections (90–150 minutes) during peak weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather windows.</strong> Check forecasts at T‑72, T‑48, T‑24, day‑of. Move your trip forward a day if a storm window opens; earlier beats “wait and hope.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Car: winter‑ready without overpacking</h2>
      <p><strong>One‑page checklist:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintenance: oil, coolant, battery test, wipers, tire tread/pressure (include spare), washer fluid rated for freezing temps.</li>
        <li>Emergency kit: jumper cables (or battery pack), tire inflator + sealant, flashlight/headlamp, blanket, gloves/hat, hand warmers, non‑perishable snacks, water, basic first‑aid, reflective triangle.</li>
        <li>Traction: snow brush/ice scraper, small shovel, sand/kitty litter.</li>
        <li>Navigation: offline maps downloaded; paper directions for dead zones.</li>
        <li>People: car games, offline playlists, motion‑sickness bands, trash bags, sanitizer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Driving tactics:</strong> Leave with a full tank; top up at half. In cold snaps, more fuel = safer margins. Cruise control off on snow/ice; slow inputs; double following distance. Use hazard triangle and reflective vest if you must stop in poor visibility.</p>

      <h2>Train: the reliable middle</h2>
      <p><strong>Why trains shine in peak season:</strong> fewer weather diversions than planes, less security friction, roomy seating, easy snacks/bathrooms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Book reserved seats when possible; choose mid‑car for less crowd flow.</li>
        <li>Arrive 30–45 minutes early; 60+ for big stations/holidays. Watch boards for track changes.</li>
        <li>Pack a small picnic; cafe cars run out.</li>
        <li>Bring a light lock for bags if you nap; keep personal items on you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Plane: fewer surprises, faster recovery</h2>
      <p><strong>Before you book:</strong> choose early departures; nonstop when possible. If you must connect, avoid tight connections under 75 minutes in winter; prefer hubs with fewer weather shutdowns. Seats near the wing ride smoother; aisle for stretches.</p>
      <p><strong>Day‑of flow:</strong> mobile boarding passes saved offline + paper backup. Shoes that slip on/off, belt packed, liquids in a ready bag. At security: pockets emptied into bag, laptop/tablet accessible, follow 3‑1‑1.</p>
      <p><strong>If it cancels:</strong> rebook yourself in the airline app first; then queue for an agent. Search partner airlines and nearby airports. Ask for interline reissue if eligible. If stranded, request vouchers; keep receipts for insurance/credit card protections.</p>

      <h2>Gifts and food without drama</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ship gifts ahead</strong> with a week of buffer. If flying, leave gifts unwrapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Food on planes:</strong> solids are fine; liquids/gels (gravies, jams) count toward 3‑1‑1. For trains/cars: spill‑proof containers; label allergens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Documents, meds, and “I forgot” fixes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>ID/passport, insurance, roadside numbers, reservation codes, pet records.</li>
        <li>Meds: 3–5 extra days in original containers; a short med list on paper.</li>
        <li>“I forgot” kit: USB‑C + Lightning + USB‑A, spare wall brick, short extension cord, 2 Ziplocs, fold‑flat tote.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kids and elders: pacing beats speed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan motion/focus cycles: 45–60 minutes of activity → 30–40 minutes of screens/quiet; snacks every 2–3 hours.</li>
        <li>Priority seating/early boarding helps elders; request wheelchair service early if needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Travel apps that actually help</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Flight: airline app, Flighty/FlightAware, TripIt, LoungeBuddy.</li>
        <li>Road: Google Maps + offline, Waze, GasBuddy, PlugShare (EV).</li>
        <li>Train: operator app (Amtrak/regionals), rail planner.</li>
        <li>Docs: 1Password or secure notes; cloud scan of IDs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A calm arrival ritual</h2>
      <p>Unpack immediately, charge devices, quick shower, 10‑minute tidy of your space, set tomorrow’s alarm, drink water, and take a short walk. It resets travel stress faster than collapsing on the couch.</p>

      <p>Travel calm isn’t magic—it’s a set of defaults you reuse: three containers, generous timing, weather windows, and a simple contingency plan for each mode.</p>
