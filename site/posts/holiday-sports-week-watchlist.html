      <p>Holiday sports are about two things: meaningful games and shared screens. This guide hits both—what matters across leagues and how to keep it fun when the living room gets crowded.</p>

      <h2>NFL: Thanksgiving, rivalry, and playoff math</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Thanksgiving slate: traditional hosts + prime‑time cap; watch QB health and playoff tiebreakers.</li>
        <li>Wild‑card race: head‑to‑head and division records matter most now.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>College Football: rivalry week + title slots</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rivalry weekend often sets conference title games and CFP positioning.</li>
        <li>Watch windows: Noon ET rivalries, mid‑afternoon ranked clashes, and prime‑time heavyweights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>NBA: early form checks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contenders tighten benches in marquee games—preview of playoff rotations.</li>
        <li>Track second‑year leaps and veterans on new teams in national TV slots.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>NHL: road trips and goaltending</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Back‑to‑backs around the holiday affect starts; hot hands vs. rest decisions tilt outcomes.</li>
        <li>PK/PP trends stabilize by now—good barometers in tight games.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>MLS / International</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>MLS Cup playoffs may still be alive; check fixtures and streaming details.</li>
        <li>International friendlies/tournaments pop up; confirm schedules day‑of.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to watch sanely with family</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick two priority windows; announce early and stick to them.</li>
        <li>Second‑screen quietly with captions; keep volume reasonable.</li>
        <li>Make it social: prop cards, squares, or a simple bingo keeps casual viewers engaged.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Setup checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet stable (reboot router day‑before), streaming logins verified.</li>
        <li>Spare HDMI cable, remote batteries, captions on by default.</li>
        <li>Soft throw on every seat—comfort keeps viewers happy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Enjoy the games—and the company. The wins are sweeter when the room’s happy too.</p>
