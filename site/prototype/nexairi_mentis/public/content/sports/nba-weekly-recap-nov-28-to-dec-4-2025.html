    <h1>Weekly NBA Recap: Thunder’s Historic Start and Pistons’ Eastern Surge</h1>

    <p>Between November 28 and December 4, the 2025–26 NBA season took on a clearer shape at the top of both conferences. The Oklahoma City Thunder kept up a historic pace in the West while the Detroit Pistons solidified their status as a genuine Eastern Conference frontrunner.</p>
    <p>Behind them, a crowded pack of contenders and upstarts traded statement wins and bad losses, with injuries and rotation gambles beginning to separate disciplined teams from those still searching for an identity.</p>

    <h2>The week at a glance</h2>
    <p>Oklahoma City closed the week at 21–1, still on track for an all‑time win pace and sitting atop the Western Conference. The Thunder’s defensive efficiency and late‑game poise turned multiple close contests into comfortable finishes, reinforcing the sense that their ceiling is higher than anyone else’s right now.</p>
    <p>In the East, Detroit rode its balance and depth to a 17–5 record, staying ahead of a tight cluster of challengers that now includes the Toronto Raptors, New York Knicks, Miami Heat and Orlando Magic.</p>

    <h2>Statement wins and bad losses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thunder 21st win keeps historic pace.</strong> Oklahoma City added to its league‑best record by closing out multiple road games with disciplined half‑court execution.</li>
      <li><strong>Pistons hold serve at 17–5.</strong> Detroit’s latest wins reinforced that its early surge is not a fluke; the Pistons paired efficient offense with enough length and physicality to survive off‑nights from their stars.</li>
      <li><strong>Raptors and Knicks trade resume wins.</strong> Both Toronto and New York picked up victories over quality opposition, tightening the race just behind Detroit.</li>
      <li><strong>Clippers slide deeper into trouble.</strong> Los Angeles dropped to 5–16 and continues to spiral near the bottom of the West.</li>
      <li><strong>Jazz hover below .500 with tough schedule.</strong> Utah’s 7–13 mark after a challenging run of road games illustrates how a young roster can struggle to close games against veteran cores.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Players who shifted the landscape</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oklahoma City’s lead star.</strong> The Thunder’s offensive hub continued to post elite scoring and playmaking lines, repeatedly orchestrating efficient late‑game sets.</li>
      <li><strong>Detroit’s centerpiece.</strong> The Pistons’ primary scorer delivered high‑usage nights without collapsing the offense, pairing clutch buckets with improved decision‑making.</li>
      <li><strong>New York and Miami wings.</strong> Perimeter scorers on both the Knicks and Heat carried heavy two‑way loads and guarded top assignments while shouldering pick‑and‑roll work.</li>
      <li><strong>Rising rookies and sophomores.</strong> The 2025 class continues to look strong, with young players already logging rotation‑level impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Injuries and storylines to monitor</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key guards managing lower‑body issues.</strong> Multiple starting ball‑handlers across playoff hopefuls landed on the report with knee or leg concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>Contenders juggling rest and fines.</strong> A high‑profile fine for improper rest policy usage signals teams have less wiggle room for load management on national broadcasts.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract and future‑fit speculation.</strong> Debates about whether franchises will keep aging stars or pivot around younger cores are starting to leak into performance.</li>
    </ul>
