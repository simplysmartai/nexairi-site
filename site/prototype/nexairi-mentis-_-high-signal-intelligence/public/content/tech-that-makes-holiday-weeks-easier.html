      <p>Holiday weeks compress guests, bags, schedules, and expectations into small spaces. The best technology for these weeks doesn’t feel flashy—it removes friction quietly. Here’s a brand‑agnostic checklist that works in apartments or houses.</p>

      <h2>Connectivity: stable first, then fast</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Guest Wi‑Fi with posted QR code; keep main devices on private SSID.</li>
        <li>Router centered, off the floor; reboot 24 hours before guests.</li>
        <li>Mesh node near guest rooms if you have dead zones.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Power and charging: the bottleneck killer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two power stations (living + guest), with AC + USB‑C + USB‑A; label cables.</li>
        <li>Travel strip + compact cube for hotel/older homes.</li>
        <li>Cable caddy: spare cables, wall brick, 6‑foot USB‑C.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Light and noise: comfort without cost</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Warm lamps on smart plugs/timers: on at sunset, off at midnight.</li>
        <li>Nightlights in hallways/bathrooms.</li>
        <li>White‑noise apps or compact machine near guest rooms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kitchen flow: heat, hold, and signal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Probe thermometer; set alerts at 160°F breast.</li>
        <li>Electric kettle; keeps stove free.</li>
        <li>Labels for leftovers, allergens, and “hands off.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Travel kits that travel well</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Battery pack, dual‑port fast charger, earbuds, compact umbrella, microfiber towel.</li>
        <li>Docs pouch: ID, cards, insurance, pen, blank cards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety and privacy, lightly</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Smart lock codes for guests; revoke after departure.</li>
        <li>Cameras off in private areas; disclose exterior cameras.</li>
        <li>Disable voice purchase; mute microphones in bedrooms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick automations (optional)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“Arrive” scene: lamps + soft music when a phone joins home Wi‑Fi.</li>
        <li>“Goodnight” scene: lamps off, porch on, thermostat eco.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Backup mindset</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Spare hotspot for ISP blips.</li>
        <li>Spare HDMI cable for movie nights.</li>
        <li>Spare earbuds for late‑night calls.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Tech should make the week feel calmer, not busier. Start with connectivity and power, add soft lighting and noise control, and keep privacy in mind. Everything else is optional.</p>
