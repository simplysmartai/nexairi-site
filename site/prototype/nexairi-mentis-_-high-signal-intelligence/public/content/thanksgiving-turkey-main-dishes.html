      <h3>Perfect Dry-Brined Roast Turkey</h3>
      <p>Achieve incredibly crispy skin and succulent, juicy meat with this fuss-free dry-brined turkey method. The salt penetrates the meat, seasoning it from within and ensuring an even cook, making for an unforgettable holiday centerpiece. Roast a 12-14 lb bird at 425°F for 30 min, then 325°F for 2-2.5 hours, aiming for 160-165°F in the breast and 170-175°F in the thigh. For best results, chill the turkey unwrapped for 2-3 days after brining, and always let it rest for 30-40 minutes before carving to redistribute juices.</p>

      <h3>Speedy Spatchcock Turkey with Herbs</h3>
      <p>Cut down your cooking time significantly and ensure every bite is tender and flavorful with a spatchcocked turkey. By removing the backbone and flattening the bird, it cooks more evenly and develops beautifully crisp skin. Roast a 12-16 lb turkey at 450°F for 80-100 minutes until breast reaches 160-165°F and thigh hits 170-175°F. To transport, carve the turkey and pack tightly in foil, reheating gently with a splash of broth. Leftovers chill well for up to 3 days.</p>
