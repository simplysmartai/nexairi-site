      <p>If you’ve started thinking seriously about milling your own grains at home, two big questions usually show up right away:</p>
      <p>“What kind of grain mill should I buy?” and “What grains do I actually need to keep on hand?”</p>
      <p>This post is here to keep that from turning into a research project. We’ll walk through the main types of home grain mills in plain language, talk about what kind of baking each one fits best, and then lay out a simple, realistic list of grains to stock so you can bake the things you already love.</p>
      <p>No guilt, no pressure to go full homesteader overnight — just friendly guidance to help you make choices that fit your kitchen and your life.</p>

      <h2>Part 1: The Mill Upgrade List</h2>
      <p>We’ve curated three top-tier options that represent the best in home milling technology right now. Whether you want speed, silence, or classic stone-ground texture, one of these will fit your workflow.</p>

      <h3>1. The Premium Stone Master</h3>
      <p>For the baker who treats flour like coffee. This mill uses corundum-ceramic stones to grind grain gently, preserving every ounce of nutrition and flavor. It offers granular control over texture, from coarse chops for morning oats to ultra-fine dust for pastry. It’s quiet, handsome on the counter, and built to last a lifetime.</p>

      <h3>2. The High-Speed Powerhouse</h3>
      <p>If you bake for a large family or just value efficiency, this is the impact mill to beat. It pulverizes grain instantly in a closed system, meaning zero dust cloud in your kitchen. It’s a workhorse designed for volume—perfect if you need six cups of flour <em>right now</em> for a big batch of loaves.</p>

      <h3>3. The Versatile Classic</h3>
      <p>A solid middle ground that balances footprint with power. It handles a wide variety of grains and legumes without complaining. It’s the choice for the practical baker who wants consistent results without over-optimizing the machinery.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: The Grain Library</h2>
      <p>Once you have a mill, you don’t need to turn your pantry into a mini grain elevator. You just need to understand the four pillars of wheat. Here is exactly what to stock.</p>

        <figcaption style="margin-top:6px;">Hard Red, Hard White, and Soft White cover 90% of your baking needs.</figcaption>

      <h3>Soft White Wheat: The Pastry Specialist</h3>
      <p><strong>Ideal For:</strong> Cakes, cookies, crackers, pastries, and Asian noodles</p>
      <p>Think of this as the "tenderizer." Soft white wheat has low protein, which means very little gluten development. It creates a fine, velvety flour that is terrible for yeast bread but incredible for delicate crumbs. If you want a biscuit that flakes or a cookie that melts, this is your grain.</p>

      <h3>Soft Red Wheat: The Snacking Grain</h3>
      <p><strong>Ideal For:</strong> Crackers, pastries, breakfast cereals, flatbreads</p>
      <p>A close cousin to Soft White but with a slightly higher protein count and a distinctive reddish hue from the bran. It’s versatile enough for some flatbreads but still leans toward tenderness. It adds a savory, cracker-like depth that white wheats miss.</p>

      <h3>Hard White Wheat: The Crowd Pleaser</h3>
      <p><strong>Ideal For:</strong> Everyday bread, pizza dough, sandwich loaves</p>
      <p>This is the powerhouse. It has high protein content for strong gluten structure (so your bread rises high), but it lacks the bitter tannins found in red wheat. The result is a golden, mild-tasting whole wheat loaf that even picky eaters usually love. It bridges the gap between nutrition and approachable flavor.</p>

      <h3>Hard Red Wheat: The Artisan Standard</h3>
      <p><strong>Ideal For:</strong> Rustic hearth loaves, sourdough, pasta</p>
      <p>The workhorse. Hard Red boasts the highest protein for the strongest elastic doughs. It yields a rich, dark, nutty loaf with that classic "wheaty" bitterness that defines artisan bread. If you want a loaf with serious character and chew, this is the grain you reach for.</p>

      <h2>Part 3: A Simple Starter Pantry List</h2>
      <p>To keep things easy, here’s a simple starter list that covers a surprising amount of baking:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>10 lbs Hard White Wheat</strong> (For everyday bread)</li>
        <li><strong>5 lbs Hard Red Wheat</strong> (For mixing into rustic loaves)</li>
        <li><strong>5 lbs Soft White Wheat</strong> (For cookies/muffins)</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> 2 lbs Rye or Spelt for flavor experiments</li>
      </ul>

      <p>With just these, you can make almost anything. You can get fancy with Einkorn and Kamut later.</p>
