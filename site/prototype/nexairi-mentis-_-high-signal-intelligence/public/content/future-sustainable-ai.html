      <p>The city of the future is not made of flying cars or neon skyscrapers; it is made of data. As urban populations swell, traditional infrastructure is buckling under the weight of demand. The solution emerging in forward-thinking metropolises from Singapore to Copenhagen is "Computational Urbanism"—the use of AI to model, predict, and optimize the flow of energy, people, and resources.</p>

      <h3>The Digital Twin</h3>
      <p>The core technology driving this shift is the "Digital Twin." Planners create a centimeter-perfect virtual replica of the city, fed by real-time sensor data. Before a new bus lane is painted or a skyscraper approved, its impact is simulated thousands of times in the digital twin. AI agents model how wind tunnels will affect pedestrian comfort, how shadows will impact solar harvesting, and how traffic congestion might ripple through adjacent neighborhoods.</p>

      <h3>Traffic as Fluid Dynamics</h3>
      <p>Old traffic lights ran on timers; new ones run on vision. Adaptive Traffic Control Systems (ATCS) use computer vision to see the volume of cars, cyclists, and pedestrians. They don't just react; they predict. By treating traffic like fluid dynamics, these algorithms can clear congestion before it forms, reducing idle time (and carbon emissions) by up to 20% without laying a single square foot of new asphalt.</p>

      <h3>The Privacy Paradox</h3>
      <p>The efficiency of a smart city relies on surveillance, which creates an immediate ethical tension. The "Sustainable AI" movement argues for <strong>Edge Processing</strong>. Instead of sending video of your car to a central server, the camera itself processes the data into anonymous vectors (e.g., "1 car, moving north") and deletes the video instantly. This allows the city to be smart without being invasive.</p>

      <h3>Energy at the Edge</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the most critical application is the smart grid. As we move to decentralized power (rooftop solar, EV batteries), the grid becomes chaotic. AI balances this load, predicting when a cloud will cover a solar farm and automatically spinning up battery reserves milliseconds before the voltage drops. It is the invisible hand that makes a renewable future physically possible.</p>
