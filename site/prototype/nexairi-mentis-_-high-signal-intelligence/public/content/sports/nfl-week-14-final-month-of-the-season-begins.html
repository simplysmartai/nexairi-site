    <h1>NFL Week 14 - Final Month of the Season Begins</h1>

    <p>Week 14 is one of those “every window matters” slates: Lions–Cowboys already shook up the NFC wild card race, and nearly every Sunday matchup has at least some playoff or seeding implication. Below is a game‑by‑game viewing guide for regular fans, with times in Eastern and TV info.</p>

    <p class="note">Note: Schedules and channels are based on league listings and national broadcast guides for Week 14 of the 2025 season; always double‑check your local listings in case of regional changes.</p>

    <h2>Thursday, December 4</h2>
    <p><strong>Detroit Lions at Dallas Cowboys — 8:15 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime Video)</strong></p>
    <p>Detroit’s explosive offense walked into this one needing to prove it could win a big road game after an uneven first half of the season, and it did exactly that, dropping 40‑plus on a Cowboys team that’s been living on the edge defensively. The Lions’ win tightened the NFC North and jumbled the wild card picture, while Dallas leaves the night staring at a steeper climb to secure both a playoff berth and home‑field advantage.</p>

    <h2>Sunday, December 7 — Early window (1 p.m. ET)</h2>

    <p><strong>New York Jets at Miami Dolphins — 1 p.m. ET (CBS)</strong></p>
    <p>Miami’s high‑octane passing game faces a Jets team that has struggled to keep pace on the scoreboard all year. For the Dolphins, this is a must‑handle spot to stay in the AFC wild card mix; dropping a road game to a sub‑.500 Jets group would undo a lot of good work from recent weeks. New York is essentially in spoiler mode, but a home upset would be one of the few bright spots in an otherwise rough campaign.</p>

    <p><strong>Cleveland Browns at Tennessee Titans — 1 p.m. ET (FOX)</strong></p>
    <p>Cleveland’s defense has kept it in the AFC hunt despite offensive inconsistency, and a trip to Tennessee is exactly the kind of game a serious contender has to bank. The Titans have leaned on toughness and the run game, but extended losing stretches have left them teetering on the edge of irrelevance; another loss here effectively buries their playoff hopes. For the Browns, a win keeps pressure on the AFC North leaders and stabilizes their wild card odds.</p>

    <p><strong>New Orleans Saints at Tampa Bay Buccaneers — 1 p.m. ET (CBS)</strong></p>
    <p>The NFC South has been a rollercoaster, and this game is a classic “two seasons diverge” moment. Tampa Bay enters with a better record and just enough offensive firepower to punish the Saints’ shaky defense, while New Orleans is trying to stop a slide that’s turned early optimism into frustration. A Bucs win keeps them firmly in the wild card and division chase; a Saints upset would keep their faint playoff pulse alive but mostly serves to complicate the race for everyone.</p>

    <p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts — 1 p.m. ET (CBS)</strong></p>
    <p>This is one of the biggest AFC South games of the year: both teams are 8–4 and very much alive for the division crown. Jacksonville’s offense has found another gear of late, but the Colts have quietly matched them win for win and control their destiny with two head‑to‑head matchups still on the schedule. Whoever wins here grabs a critical tiebreaker edge and could effectively put the other into wild card scrap mode for the rest of December.</p>

    <p><strong>Atlanta Falcons at Seattle Seahawks — 1 p.m. ET (FOX)</strong></p>
    <p>Seattle comes in as one of the NFC’s hottest teams at 9–3, carrying a genuine shot at a top seed if they keep stacking wins. The Falcons, on the other hand, are trying to salvage a 4–8 season and avoid sliding completely out of the playoff picture. For the Seahawks, this is a classic “take care of business” road game; a stumble would open the door for other NFC West and wild card contenders to leapfrog them.</p>

    <p><strong>Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers — 1 p.m. ET (CBS)</strong></p>
    <p>Both teams sit at 6–6, but the playoff math says this rivalry game matters like a late‑December elimination. Models show Baltimore can nearly lock up the division if it sweeps this matchup, while a Steelers win would put Pittsburgh in the driver’s seat yet still leave both teams with work to do down the stretch. Expect a vintage AFC North grind: physical defense, field position battles, and a playoff feel even if neither team is over .500.</p>

    <p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals at (road opponent listed in FOX/CBSSN schedules) — 1 p.m. ET (FOX)</strong></p>
    <p>Cincinnati enters Week 14 in a tight AFC race where a single loss can mean dropping multiple spots in both the division and wild card standings. The offense has flashed its old explosiveness but has also disappeared for long stretches, which makes consistency the theme of the week. Whoever they’re lined up against, the Bengals cannot afford another flat performance if they want to stay on the bracket’s right side.</p>

    <p><strong>Washington Commanders at Minnesota Vikings — 1 p.m. ET (FOX)</strong></p>
    <p>Washington is in spoiler mode, while Minnesota is clinging to the NFC wild card pack thanks to a gritty, defense‑first identity. The Vikings need to hold serve at home, especially against a Commanders team that has struggled to string together four solid quarters. If Minnesota drops this, their path narrows fast with tougher opponents looming.</p>

    <h2>Sunday, December 7 — Late afternoon window</h2>

    <p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders at Denver Broncos — 4:05 p.m. ET (CBS)</strong></p>
    <p>The Broncos are one of the AFC’s best stories, surging to 10–2 and leading the West while trying to put the rest of the conference at arm’s length. A home date with a streaky Raiders squad is exactly the sort of game a real contender has to dominate, especially with seeding and a possible first‑round bye in play. For Vegas, pulling an upset on the road would keep faint wild card hopes alive and complicate the AFC picture.</p>

    <p><strong>Arizona Cardinals at Los Angeles Rams — 4:25 p.m. ET (FOX)</strong></p>
    <p>The Rams are locked in a duel with Seattle atop the NFC West, entering the week at 9–3 and holding a tiebreaker edge thanks to an earlier head‑to‑head win. Arizona, sitting near the bottom of the conference, plays the role of chaos agent with nothing to lose. A Rams win keeps them on track for a division crown and possibly a top‑two seed; a loss would hand the NFC West back to the Seahawks and make the wild card traffic jam even messier.</p>

    <p><strong>Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears — 4:25 p.m. ET (FOX)</strong></p>
    <p>This rivalry game arrives with real stakes: the Bears are 9–3 and pacing the NFC North, while the Packers (8–3‑1) are right behind them in both the division and wild card standings. Green Bay has quietly become one of the conference’s hottest teams, and a road win here would flip the division dynamics heading into the final month. Chicago can’t afford a home stumble if it wants to hold off both the Packers and the resurgent Lions.</p>

    <h2>Sunday Night Football</h2>
    <p><strong>Houston Texans at Kansas City Chiefs — 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC/Peacock)</strong></p>
    <p>Few games on the slate have more layered implications. Houston enters at 7–5 and on a hot streak, led by an aggressive young offense that has them firmly in the AFC wild card mix; a road win at Arrowhead would cement them as one of the conference’s scariest up‑and‑coming teams. Kansas City, by contrast, has dug itself into a surprising hole and badly needs this one just to stay in realistic playoff contention, but the schedule around them is favorable if they can take care of business. A Texans win could see them leapfrog multiple teams, while a Chiefs win tightens the wild card race and keeps the reigning conference champs in the picture.</p>

    <h2>Monday Night Football, December 8</h2>
    <p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles at Los Angeles Chargers — 8:15 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)</strong></p>
    <p>The Chargers come in at 8–4 and currently hold a key AFC wild card slot, having built a resume on high‑powered offense and just‑good‑enough defense. Hosting Philadelphia on Monday night is both a showcase and a stress test—drop this game, and their margin for error in a crowded AFC shrinks dramatically. The Eagles are trying to firm up their own NFC seeding, and a road win against a quality AFC opponent would bolster both confidence and tiebreaker equity heading into the stretch run.</p>

    <p>As of Week 14, league playoff pictures and narratives above draw on the official NFL schedule, national TV listings, and current playoff‑probability breakdowns from outlets such as NFL.com, ESPN, CBS Sports, Yahoo Sports, and Bleacher Report, along with league operations schedule releases and network broadcast guides.</p>
