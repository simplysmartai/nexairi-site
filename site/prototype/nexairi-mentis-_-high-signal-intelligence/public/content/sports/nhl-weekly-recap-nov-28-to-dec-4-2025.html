    <h1>Weekly NHL Recap: Avalanche’s Push, Panthers’ Reality Check, and a Crowded Wild‑Card Race</h1>

    <p>From November 28 through December 4, the 2025–26 NHL season shifted into its next gear. Colorado pushed toward the top of the league table, several Eastern powers traded momentum, and the defending champion Florida Panthers were reminded how hard a three‑peat really is. [web:303][web:308][web:311][web:312]</p>
    <p>Underneath the headline teams, the wild‑card races in both conferences tightened, with a cluster of clubs separated by only a couple of points and goal differential starting to matter as much as raw wins. [web:303][web:309][web:312][web:321]</p>

    <h2>The week at a glance</h2>
    <p>Colorado’s strong run through late November carried into this stretch, with the Avalanche continuing to bank points and drive play at five‑on‑five. Their combination of top‑end star power and depth scoring kept them on the short list of early Presidents’ Trophy favourites. [web:311][web:318][web:321]</p>
    <p>In the East, Tampa Bay, Detroit and several Atlantic rivals jockeyed for position while Metro teams tried to keep pace. A mix of high‑event shootouts and tight defensive games underscored how different styles can still produce similar records when special teams and goaltending wobble from night to night. [web:303][web:309][web:312]</p>

    <h2>Statement wins and bad losses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bruins roll past Blues in Boston.</strong> Boston’s 5–2 home win over St. Louis on December 4 featured two goals from Pavel Zacha and a strong territorial game that quieted concerns after a patchy stretch. It was the kind of home‑ice performance the Bruins needed to stay in the thick of the Atlantic race. [web:305][web:313][web:316]</li>
      <li><strong>Blue Jackets rally past Red Wings.</strong> Columbus capped a wild week with a comeback shootout win over Detroit, powered by a multi‑goal night from Adam Fantilli and big saves from Elvis Merzlikins. For the Red Wings, the loss extended a slide that has turned a hot start into a nervy stretch. [web:307]</li>
      <li><strong>Contenders stumble against bottom‑feeders.</strong> A handful of playoff hopefuls dropped points to teams nearer the draft lottery line, reinforcing how dangerous schedule traps can be when rosters are banged up or looking ahead to marquee matchups. [web:305][web:310][web:319]</li>
      <li><strong>Pacific and Central chaos.</strong> Results in the Western Conference’s middle tier shuffled the wild‑card order almost nightly, with clubs like Los Angeles, Winnipeg and Calgary trading spots as they alternated strong efforts with flat showings. [web:303][web:305][web:306]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Players who shifted the landscape</h2>
    <p>Individual performances this week didn’t just fill highlight reels; they nudged playoff odds and award discussions. [web:307][web:308][web:311]</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adam Fantilli (Blue Jackets).</strong> The sophomore center scored twice and added the tying goal with the goalie pulled in Columbus’s 6–5 shootout win over Detroit, a night that showcased why he’s central to the franchise’s timeline. [web:307]</li>
      <li><strong>Columbus playmakers.</strong> Zach Werenski and Sean Monahan each finished that game with three assists, driving offense from the back end and reinforcing how much more dangerous the Jackets look when their blue line is active. [web:307]</li>
      <li><strong>Detroit’s veterans.</strong> Patrick Kane, Alex DeBrincat and Dylan Larkin all contributed goals and primary points in the same contest, but their output wasn’t enough to hide defensive breakdowns and a leaky penalty kill during the week. [web:307]</li>
      <li><strong>Boston’s top six.</strong> Zacha’s two‑goal night against St. Louis, combined with steady contributions from the Bruins’ forward core, gave Boston a template for what winning by committee has to look like post‑Bergeron and post‑Krejci. [web:316]</li>
      <li><strong>Goaltenders on the bubble.</strong> In several markets—including traditional powers in Canada and the U.S.—netminders alternated between stealing games and posting sub‑.900 nights, keeping fan bases and front offices equally anxious. [web:311][web:314][web:319]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Injuries and storylines to monitor</h2>
    <p>The league’s big‑picture narratives—Florida’s three‑peat bid, the Olympic break, and aging cores chasing one more run—were all threaded through this week’s boxscores. [web:308][web:311][web:320]</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Florida’s path to a three‑peat gets steeper.</strong> The Panthers are still dealing with the physical toll of back‑to‑back Cups, and key injuries on the blue line and in the top six are testing their depth just as rivals begin to round into form. [web:308][web:311]</li>
      <li><strong>Olympic roster pressure.</strong> With an NHL return to the Olympics looming, national team conversations are affecting how fans and media read every hot streak and slump from star players and bubble candidates alike. [web:308][web:311][web:320]</li>
      <li><strong>Underperforming traditional powers.</strong> Teams that entered the year as presumptive contenders have been forced into early‑season soul‑searching as defensive woes, special‑teams issues and aging cores collide. [web:311][web:314][web:320]</li>
      <li><strong>Line juggling and prospect auditions.</strong> Coaches across the league continued to tinker with combinations, giving young forwards and depth defenders chances higher in the lineup as injuries and cap constraints bite. [web:311][web:317]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to watch next week</h2>
    <p>December’s schedule offers a mix of marquee showdowns and gut‑check road trips that will either solidify the current hierarchy or drag more teams back toward the middle. [web:305][web:311][web:314]</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Colorado versus other Cup hopefuls.</strong> Games against top‑half Western and Eastern opponents will test whether the Avalanche’s territorial dominance holds up against deeper benches.</li>
      <li><strong>Florida’s response to adversity.</strong> How the Panthers navigate injuries, minutes for their stars, and the weight of a potential three‑peat will say a lot about whether they can still dictate series on their terms. [web:308][web:311]</li>
      <li><strong>Atlantic logjam tilts.</strong> Head‑to‑head matchups among Tampa Bay, Detroit, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa will create real separation—or drag the division into an even messier traffic jam. [web:303][web:309][web:318]</li>
      <li><strong>Canadian market pressure cookers.</strong> Struggling heavyweights in Toronto, Edmonton and other Canadian cities will face mounting scrutiny if defensive issues and inconsistent goaltending persist. [web:311][web:314]</li>
      <li><strong>Wild‑card line watch.</strong> Every night, check which teams sit one or two points above or below the cut line; those clubs are already in playoff‑style urgency mode long before the All‑Star break. [web:309][web:312][web:321]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For Nexairi readers, the signal this week is clear: look past nightly swings in emotion and focus on who consistently tilts the ice, survives injury waves, and solves special‑teams problems. Those are the teams that will still matter when the bracket locks in April.</p>
