  <section>
    <p>Below are the non‑CFP FBS bowl games scheduled from the start of bowl season through December 23, 2025. Each game block includes a schedule line (date, kickoff in ET, TV), a concise 4–5 sentence editorial blurb, an image prompt for the hero, and source URLs. Kickoff times and TV listings are marked with <strong>[VERIFY]</strong> until confirmed by the research agent (ESPN, NCAA, FBSchedules, BowlSeason, Fox, CBS). See the notes at the end for verification and publishing instructions.</p>

    Template for each game (replace bracketed placeholders with authoritative values):

    <section class="nx-article__game">
      <h2>[BOWL NAME] — [TEAM A] vs [TEAM B]</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> [YYYY-MM-DD] &nbsp; <strong>Kickoff (ET):</strong> [HH:MM] [VERIFY] &nbsp; <strong>TV:</strong> [NETWORK] [VERIFY]</p>
      <p>[4–5 sentence blurb: 1–2 sentences on Team A season/form, 1–2 sentences on Team B, 1–2 on the bowl identity/history, 1 sentence on what's at stake]</p>

  <!-- Example filled block (editorial sample; schedule fields must be verified) -->
  <section class="nx-article__game">
    <h2>Bahamas Bowl — Team A vs Team B</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-12-XX &nbsp; <strong>Kickoff (ET):</strong> XX:XX <strong>[VERIFY]</strong> &nbsp; <strong>TV:</strong> ESPN+ / [VERIFY]</p>
    <p>Team A enjoyed a balanced season with an efficient rushing attack and a bend-but-don't-break defense that held up in close games. Team B leaned on a breakout wide receiver corps to pull off several upset wins but struggled against top defenses. The Bahamas Bowl has become a fan-friendly, destination game that pairs mid‑major teams looking for postseason momentum. What’s at stake: extra practices, positive momentum for recruiting, and bowl‑season bragging rights.</p>
    <p><em>Image prompt:</em> "[Team A] vs [Team B] action shot, editorial, shallow depth of field, 1600x900"</p>

  <h3>Notes & Verification</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Every schedule line (date/time/TV) must be cross‑checked against primary sources: NCAA schedule pages, ESPN, FBSchedules, BowlSeason, and network listings (Fox, CBS, ESPN). The orchestrator will attempt to populate these automatically; any <strong>[VERIFY]</strong> tokens mean human confirmation is required.</li>
    <li><strong>Image policy:</strong> Use licensed photography where available. If generating AI imagery, use the `imagePrompt` fields in the article frontmatter and ensure images are released under a permissive internal use policy; add `imageUrl` to frontmatter after upload.</li>
    <li><strong>SEO & Metadata:</strong> Confirm `summary` <= 200 characters, set `isFeatured` if desired, and add canonical URL/og tags in the site metadata before publishing.</li>
    <li><strong>Publishing workflow:</strong> Once the draft is approved, merge the PR into `main`. Cloudflare Pages will pick up the change and deploy the post. If the orchestrator produced `public/posts.json` updates, ensure `npm run validate-posts` passes in the PR checks.</li>
  </ul>
