    <h2>9 Alabama at 8 Oklahoma</h2>
    <p><strong>December 19 (Friday) · 8:00 PM ET</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Gaylord Family - Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, Norman, OK</strong></p>
    <p>Few brands in college football are as iconic as Alabama and Oklahoma, and now they collide under playoff lights. The Crimson Tide are in an unfamiliar underdog role, desperate to prove they still belong among the elite. Oklahoma's explosive offense and rowdy home crowd make this a pressure cooker for both teams. Expect fireworks, big plays, and plenty of playoff tension in Norman as old-school tradition meets new-age energy.</p>

    <h2>10 Miami at 7 Texas A&M</h2>
    <p><strong>December 20 (Saturday) · 12:00 PM ET</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Kyle Field, College Station, TX</strong></p>
    <p>Miami's swagger meets Texas-sized confidence in this noon kickoff at Kyle Field. The Hurricanes have been a rollercoaster team all season, capable of brilliance or chaos, depending on the quarter. Texas A&M's defense will test Miami's speed, and the Aggies' home-field advantage could be a difference-maker. For fans of passion, unpredictability, and hat-tilting rivalries, this one brings the heat before lunchtime.</p>

    <h2>11 Tulane at 6 Ole Miss</h2>
    <p><strong>December 20 (Saturday) · 3:30 PM ET</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, Oxford, MS</strong></p>
    <p>Tulane, the Group of Five standout, gets its another shot at the SEC heavyweight in a battle for national respect and a chance to face UGA in the next round. An Ole Miss squad still settling in after Lane Kiffin's departure, boasts one of the country's most potent offenses, but Tulane's discipline and toughness can frustrate any favorite. It's a matchup of styles—flash versus fundamentals—and that tension could make for a thriller. If Cinderella stories are your thing, the Green Wave might just make some noise in Oxford.</p>

    <h2>12 James Madison at 5 Oregon</h2>
    <p><strong>December 20 (Saturday) · 7:30 PM ET</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Autzen Stadium, Eugene, OR</strong></p>
    <p>James Madison's dream season continues with a daunting trip to face Oregon in one of college football's loudest venues. The Ducks' speed and offensive creativity make them a nightmare matchup, but JMU's underdog grit has defied expectations all year. Oregon's quest for a deep playoff run starts here, but overlooking the Dukes could spell trouble. This is the classic David vs. Goliath clash that makes December football irresistible.</p>
