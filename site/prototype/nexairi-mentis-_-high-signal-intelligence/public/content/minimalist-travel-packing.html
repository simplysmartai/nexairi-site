      <p>There is a direct correlation between the weight of your bag and the quality of your trip. A heavy bag anchors you to taxis, elevators, and hotels. A light bag gives you the freedom to take the stairs, jump on a train, or walk straight to dinner from the airport. Minimalist packing is not about deprivation; it is about precision.</p>

      <h3>The Rule of Three</h3>
      <p>The core philosophy of one-bag travel is the Rule of Three: wear one, wash one, dry one. You do not need seven shirts for a seven-day trip. You need three high-quality shirts and a sink. By breaking the psychological link between "days of travel" and "outfits packed," you can travel indefinitely with a 30-liter backpack.</p>

      <h3>Fabrics That Work for You</h3>
      <p>Cotton is the enemy of the minimalist traveler. It is heavy, it holds odors, and it takes forever to dry. The solution is <strong>Merino Wool</strong>. It is naturally antimicrobial (meaning you can wear it multiple days without smell), temperature regulating, and quick-drying. A single merino t-shirt does the work of three cotton ones. For pants, look for technical synthetics with 4-way stretch that look like chinos but perform like gym wear.</p>

      <h3>The Tech Consolidation</h3>
      <p>Cables and chargers often weigh more than clothes. Adopt a strict USB-C protocol. If a device does not charge via USB-C, it stays home. A single 65W GaN (Gallium Nitride) charger is the size of a golf ball but can power your laptop, phone, and camera. Pair it with two high-quality cables, and your tech kit fits in a sunglasses case.</p>

      <h3>Liquids and Toiletries</h3>
      <p>We pack toiletries for our worst days, not our average days. You do not need the full medicine cabinet. Pack solids where possible (shampoo bars, toothpaste tabs) to bypass TSA liquid limits. For liquids, use high-quality silicone tubes (like GoToob) or flat-pack pouches (Matador) that compress as you use them. Remember: unless you are going to the moon, you can buy soap when you get there.</p>

      <h3>The Verdict</h3>
      <p>Packing light is a skill that improves with every trip. The first time you leave the "just in case" items at home feels risky. The moment you sprint to catch a train with your bag on your back and realize you aren't out of breath, you will never check a bag again.</p>
