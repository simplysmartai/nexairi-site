      <p>You made the plan. You prepped the sides. Now the day is here. This is not a guide to cooking (we did that already); this is a guide to <em>managing</em> the day so you can actually sit down when the food is hot.</p>
      
      <h2>08:00 AM - Clear and Coffee</h2>
      <p>Before you touch a pan, empty the dishwasher and trash. Fill the sink with hot soapy water. Make a full pot of coffee. A clear workspace is a clear mind.</p>

      <h2>09:00 AM - Turkey Time</h2>
      <p>Get the bird in. Double-check your math on cook time. Set an alarm for 30 minutes <em>before</em> you think it's done. Once it's in, you have a 3-hour window. Use it to shower and get dressed. Do not cook in your pajamas; you won't feel ready when guests arrive.</p>

      <h2>11:00 AM - The Chill Breaker</h2>
      <p>Pull all your make-ahead casseroles (potatoes, stuffing, green beans) out of the fridge. They need 60 minutes on the counter to lose their chill before they hit the oven. If you bake them cold, the centers will be lukewarm.</p>

      <h2>12:00 PM - The Switch</h2>
      <p>The turkey is likely done or close. Check temp (165°F breast). When it's good, pull it. Tent it with foil. It stays hot for 90 minutes easily. Do not cut it yet.</p>
      <p><strong>Crank the oven:</strong> Turn heat up to 375°F or 400°F for the sides. Put them all in.</p>

      <h2>01:00 PM - Gravy and Glaze</h2>
      <p>While sides bake, make your gravy using the pan drippings. Glaze any stove-top carrots. Whip the cream for pie now so the mixer isn't screaming during dinner.</p>

      <h2>02:00 PM - Carve and Serve</h2>
      <p>Carve the bird in the kitchen, not at the table (it's messy and stressful). Platter it. Pull hot sides. Transfer to serving bowls if you're fancy, or put trivets on the table if you're rustic.</p>

      <p><strong>The most important step:</strong> Pour yourself a drink, sit down, and do not get up for at least 20 minutes. You did it.</p>
