      <h3>Creamy Vegan Mushroom Soup</h3>
      <p>This mushroom soup layers caramelized mushrooms, aromatics, and silky cashew “cream” for big flavor without dairy. It’s naturally vegan/gluten-free and reheats gently on the stovetop. Chill in mason jars, then warm with a splash of broth for day-two bowls.</p>

      <h3>Slow-Cooker Butternut Squash Soup</h3>
      <p>Let the slow cooker take over with this velvety squash puree. It’s vegetarian (easily vegan with vegetable broth) and travels right inside the crock. Batch-freeze; thaw overnight and reheat with a whisk to restore the silky finish.</p>

      <h3>Historic Creamy Pumpkin Soup (from 1651)</h3>
      <p>Inspired by a 17th-century recipe, this pumpkin soup keeps the ingredient list short and the texture lush. Vegetarian and easily dairy-free, it’s a make-ahead hero: cool completely, portion, and reheat slowly, whisking to bring it back to velvet.</p>

      <h3>Elegant Parsnip Apple Soup with Lotus Root Chips</h3>
      <p>Sweet parsnip meets tart apple in a refined puree topped with crispy lotus chips. Vegetarian, naturally gluten-free, and dairy-free with plant cream. Store the base in jars; fry the chips just before service for that delicate crunch.</p>

      <h3>Warming Pumpkin Curry Soup</h3>
      <p>Pumpkin, coconut milk, and warming curry paste create a lightly spicy soup that’s vegan, gluten-free, and freezer-friendly. Reheat with a splash of broth to keep it lush, then finish with lime and cilantro for brightness.</p>

      <h3>Hearty Zuppa Toscana Soup</h3>
      <p>Sausage, potatoes, kale, and garlic-scented cream make this a crowd-friendly bowl. Not dairy-free, but it reheats well over low heat—add a splash of broth to loosen it after refrigeration.</p>

      <h3>Comforting Tortellini Soup with Sausage & Spinach</h3>
      <p>Cheese tortellini, browned sausage, and spinach simmer in a creamy broth. Make the base ahead; cook tortellini separately and add just before serving to keep the pasta al dente.</p>

      <h3>Flavorful Slow-Cooker Turkey Chili</h3>
      <p>Lean turkey, beans, and spices simmer low and slow for a protein-rich chili that’s dairy-free and naturally gluten-free. Pack toppings separately; reheat gently and add a splash of broth if it thickens.</p>

      <h3>Wholesome Slow-Cooker Ham and Bean Soup</h3>
      <p>Smoky ham hock, tender beans, and vegetables simmer into a deeply satisfying winter soup. It’s naturally gluten-free; transport in the slow cooker and reheat on low, stirring occasionally.</p>

      <h3>Easy Chicken and Andouille Gumbo</h3>
      <p>A nutty roux anchors this gumbo loaded with chicken, andouille, and aromatics. Naturally dairy-free, it actually improves after a night in the fridge. Reheat slowly in a Dutch oven and add a splash of stock if it tightens up.</p>
