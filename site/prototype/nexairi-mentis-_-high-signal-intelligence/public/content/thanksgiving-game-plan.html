      <p>Most Thanksgiving stress isn’t about the recipes, it’s about timing. Everything has to be hot, carved, sauced, and on the table at roughly the same moment, which is a wild ask for a home kitchen. A simple game plan — written down, not just in your head — turns the day from improv panic into a series of small, clear steps.</p>
      <p>This guide gives you an hour-by-hour timeline, a basic oven map, and safe holding temperatures so you know what can rest, what must be served fresh, and what can happily hang out in a warm spot until everyone finally sits down.</p>

      <h2>The Night Before</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the bird.</strong> Make sure your turkey is fully thawed. If it’s still icy in the center, keep it in the fridge but move it to a slightly warmer shelf and remove any extra packaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Set the table.</strong> Lay out plates, glasses, silverware, napkins, and any decor tonight. One less task for Future You.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm the menu.</strong> Make a short list of what absolutely has to hit the table hot (turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes) versus “warm is fine” (stuffing, roasted veggies, rolls).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Thanksgiving Morning</h2>
      <h3>8:00–9:00 a.m.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear and wipe down your counters. Designate one area for raw turkey and one “clean zone” for everything else.</li>
        <li>Pull make-ahead dishes from the fridge so they lose the initial chill. Cold casseroles take much longer to heat through.</li>
        <li>Review your timeline and mark any last-minute jobs for guests (someone can be “rolls captain” or “drink person”).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>9:00–10:00 a.m.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven according to your turkey recipe — usually 325–350°F (163–177°C).</li>
        <li>Season and prep the turkey, then get it into the oven on time. Most birds roast 13–15 minutes per pound at 325°F, but follow your specific recipe and use a thermometer.</li>
        <li>Start a simple dishwashing rhythm: fill the sink with hot soapy water and drop in utensils and bowls as you go.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Midday: While the Turkey Roasts</h2>
      <h3>11:00 a.m.–1:00 p.m.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prep salad greens and cold sides; keep them covered in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Assemble any last casseroles that weren’t made ahead (mac and cheese, extra stuffing, etc.).</li>
        <li>Check the turkey’s internal temperature occasionally, aiming for 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the breast and 175–180°F (79–82°C) in the thigh.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Build Your Oven Map</h2>
      <p>Ovens are high-stakes real estate on Thanksgiving. Make a quick oven map on paper:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top rack:</strong> Dishes that benefit from browning and crispy edges (stuffing, roasted vegetables).</li>
        <li><strong>Middle rack:</strong> The turkey and any “main character” casseroles.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom rack:</strong> Items in sturdy dishes that just need to reheat through (sweet potatoes, extra pans of stuffing, rolls in foil).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stagger bake times so everything doesn’t fight for the same rack at once. If something finishes early, move it to “holding mode” (see below) instead of overcooking it.</p>
      <h2>Safe Holding Temps (Without Drying Everything Out)</h2>
      <p>Food safety and texture are the two dials you’re balancing. In general:</p>

</figure>



      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hot food safe zone:</strong> Above 140°F (60°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Cold food safe zone:</strong> Below 40°F (4°C).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On Thanksgiving, that means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a low oven (around 200°F / 93°C) to keep casseroles and roasted vegetables warm without burning.</li>
        <li>Cover dishes loosely with foil to keep in moisture.</li>
        <li>Let the turkey rest tented with foil; carryover cooking will finish the job while juices redistribute.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>One Hour Before Dinner</h2>
      <h3>60 minutes out</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check all sides: anything still fridge-cold should go into the oven now.</li>
        <li>Start gently reheating make-ahead gravy on the stovetop or in a small slow cooker, whisking in a splash of stock as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>30 minutes out</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the turkey out when it reaches the correct internal temperature; tent it with foil and let it rest.</li>
        <li>Move stuffing and vegetables to higher racks to crisp the tops if needed.</li>
        <li>Warm rolls wrapped in foil, either in the oven or toaster oven.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>15 minutes out</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfer finished dishes to serving platters and bowls.</li>
        <li>Give cold dishes (salads, cranberry sauce) a quick stir and place them on the table.</li>
        <li>Carve the turkey onto a board or platter, and ladle gravy into a warm gravy boat or pitcher.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Backup Plans (Because Real Life Happens)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Turkey is taking forever:</strong> Turn the oven up by 25°F, tent the breast with foil to keep it from drying, and lean on sides to keep everyone snacking until it’s done.</li>
        <li><strong>Turkey is done too early:</strong> Rest it for 30–45 minutes, then carve and hold slices in a covered pan with a splash of hot stock or gravy in a low oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Something burns:</strong> Scrape off what you can, re-plate the salvageable portion, and don’t apologize. The story will be funnier later.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A written game plan is basically future kindness. Hang this timeline on the fridge, hand out small tasks to whoever wanders into the kitchen, and let the day unfold without constantly doing mental math over the sound of timers.</p>
