      <p>Every rig starts with a sturdy frame, force-feedback controls, and screens that keep your sight lines realistic. Drawing on insights from the wider sim-racing community, this guide breaks down how to assemble a budget, mid-range, and top-tier cockpit—each stocked with components that balance cost against lap-time precision.</p>

      <p>Use this tiered breakdown to match your spend to your seat time, then fine-tune with cable management, tactile feedback, and PC specs that keep frame rates pinned.</p>

      <h3>Tier 1: Budget Pit Lane (~$600-$1,000)</h3>
      <p>The entry-level philosophy is simple: prioritize smooth inputs over flashy screens. A DIY timber frame (à la Supercheap Auto’s concept) or a simple wheel stand keeps costs low, allowing you to spend more on the pedals—the most critical interface in the car.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DIY or flat-pack cockpit:</strong> Cut plywood to mimic angled side rails or grab an entry stand like the GT Omega Classic. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sim+racing+wheel+stand&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop starter wheel stands</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Gear-driven wheel + pedals:</strong> Logitech's G29/G920 packs console/PC support plus steel pedal arms for progressive braking. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=logitech+g29&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find Logitech G29 bundles</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Repurposed bucket or office seat:</strong> Bolt an inexpensive fixed-back seat to your base or reuse an office chair with locking casters. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=racing+bucket+seat&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browse budget seats</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Single 32" display:</strong> Mount an existing TV at eye level or choose a 32-inch 1080p monitor for low-latency inputs. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=32+inch+1080p+monitor&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare 32" monitors</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional immersion add-ons:</strong> Clip-on fans and a basic bass transducer deliver motion cues without expensive actuators. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=buttkicker+gamer&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">See entry tactile kits</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tier 2: Mid-Range Club Sport (~$1,800-$3,500)</h3>
      <p>This is the sweet spot for enthusiasts. The jump to aluminum profile (8020) chassis and load-cell pedals offers the biggest realism upgrade you will experience. These components are modular, meaning you buy them once and upgrade around them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>8020 aluminum cockpit:</strong> A profile chassis like the Next Level Racing GT Track or Trak Racer TR80 resists flex and makes mounting button boxes trivial. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aluminum+sim+racing+cockpit&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop aluminum rigs</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-power direct drive wheelbase:</strong> Pair a Moza R9 or Fanatec CSL DD with a round GT rim for endurance sessions. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=moza+r9&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browse direct drive bundles</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Load-cell pedal set:</strong> CSL Elite V2 or Moza SRP pedals let you brake by muscle memory (pressure) instead of pedal travel. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=load+cell+sim+pedals&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare load-cell pedals</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Triple 27" or 34" ultrawide:</strong> Triple 27s wrap you in 180° for spatial awareness, while a single 34-inch ultrawide balances price and desk space. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=triple+monitor+sim+racing&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop triple monitor kits</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Tactile + accessories:</strong> Add a Buttkicker Gamer Pro, HE shifter mount, and USB button box for pit limiter, wipers, and radio macros. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sim+racing+button+box&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">See button boxes</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tier 3: Top-Tier Flagship (~$6,000+)</h3>
      <p>The flagship build leans on pro-grade hydraulics and motion cueing for endurance comfort. This is engineering a turnkey cockpit that mirrors GT3 telemetry.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motion-ready chassis:</strong> Combine a Sim-Lab P1X with a DOF Reality H3 or PT-Actuator platform for 3DOF surge, sway, and heave. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dof+reality+h3&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop motion platforms</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>High-torque direct drive:</strong> Fanatec Podium DD2 or Simucube 2 Pro deliver 20+ Nm for accurate kerb strikes. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fanatec+dd2&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explore DD2 availability</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydraulic or pneumatic pedals:</strong> Heusinkveld Ultimate+ or Simagic P2000 sets recreate GT brake pressures with interchangeable elastomers. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=heusinkveld+pedals&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find premium pedals</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual and telemetry stack:</strong> Run triple 55" 4K displays or pair a Varjo Aero VR headset with a dedicated telemetry tablet for live delta and tire data. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=55+inch+4k+tv&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop 55" 4K panels</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Full-scope accessories:</strong> Bolt in a genuine racing seat with FIA harness, dedicated wind simulator, and tactile transducers on each corner. <a href='https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sim+racing+harness&tag=nexairimentis-20 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browse harness kits</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>PC and Console Requirements</h3>
      <p>For mid-to-high tiers, target a GPU like the NVIDIA RTX 4070 or better to maintain high frame rates on triple screens at 1440p. Console racers are best suited for the budget tier but should verify wheelbase compatibility with Xbox or PlayStation firmware before buying.</p>

      <h3>Setup Checklist</h3>
      <p>Before your first shakedown lap, torque every bolt, level the seat sliders, set pedal angles to match your road car, and back up wheelbase profiles. Keep a cable map taped under the rig so future upgrades stay painless.</p>
