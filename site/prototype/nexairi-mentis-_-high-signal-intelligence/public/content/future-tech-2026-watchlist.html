      <p>Most “next year” tech lists oversell and under‑deliver. Here’s a sober watchlist for 2026: areas where utility is catching up to hype—and how to evaluate them at home or work.</p>

      <h2>Edge AI that respects privacy</h2>
      <p>Small, efficient models running on phones, laptops, and home hubs reduce latency and keep data local. Expect: transcription, translation, summarization, on‑device image enhancement, and personal automations that don’t hit the cloud.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Local vs cloud fallback; clear privacy settings.</li>
        <li>Battery impact and throttling; offline modes.</li>
        <li>Export of data/models (avoid lock‑in).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practical AR (not just demo reels)</h2>
      <p>Lightweight viewers for directions, transcription, and hands‑free checklists have real use in fieldwork, travel, and accessibility. The hits will be boring: comfort, battery life, and UI that gets out of the way.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comfort for 60–90 minutes; prescription support.</li>
        <li>Glare handling outdoors; pairing with phone sensors for GPS.</li>
        <li>App types: directions, captions, context cards, camera assist.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Better batteries and charging hygiene</h2>
      <p>Incremental chemistry + smarter charging will feel like “my phone lasts” more than spec leaps. At home: more USB‑C, fewer bricks, bidirectional options in cars and power stations.</p>
      <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong> use 20–80% charging where possible; prefer USB‑C PD with e‑marked cables; buy fewer, better power stations.</p>

      <h2>Resilient home networking</h2>
      <p>Multi‑link routers that can fail over to cellular, smarter QoS for video calls, and easier guest isolation. Less speed marketing; more stability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic failover, per‑device priority, and simple guest portals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Materials that matter</h2>
      <p>Scratch‑resistant coatings, antimicrobial surfaces, recycled metals, and modular parts that extend lifespan. The trend is less throwaway, more serviceable.</p>
      <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> look for screws, not glue; published repair guides; spare parts.</p>

      <h2>Private voice and camera defaults</h2>
      <p>Expect clearer hardware mutes, on‑device wake words, and per‑room privacy modes. Good products will make privacy the easy default.</p>
      <p><strong>At home:</strong> place mics away from bedrooms; disable purchase by voice; review logs monthly.</p>

      <p>2026 won’t be magic—but it can be calmer: local AI for small wins, networks that don’t buckle, devices designed to last, and interfaces that disappear when you’re with people.</p>
