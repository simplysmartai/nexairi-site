  <h1>OpenAI's Secret Project Just Leaked—Here's Why It Matters</h1>

  <p class="intro"><em>Imagine you're the king of AI, then suddenly your biggest rival drops a model so good your CEO calls an all-hands "Code Red." That's OpenAI right now.</em></p>

  <section>
    <h2>What Happened (Simple Version)</h2>
    <p>On December 1, 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sent a company-wide memo: "Code Red." ChatGPT quality was slipping. Users were leaving. Google Gemini 3 was eating their lunch.</p>
    <p>But here's the twist - insiders leaked OpenAI's secret weapon: a model codenamed <strong>"Garlic."</strong> Not GPT-5.2 (that's later). Garlic is their emergency response - built specifically to crush Gemini 3 and Anthropic's Opus 4.5 in coding and reasoning.</p>

    <h2>Why 'Garlic'? The Inside Story</h2>
    <p>Garlic isn't sexy marketing. It's a <em>panic button model</em>. Reports say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Beats Gemini 3</strong> on coding benchmarks by 12-18 points</li>
      <li><strong>Reasoning edge</strong> over Anthropic Opus 4.5</li>
      <li>Trained on <strong>fresh 2025 data</strong> - ChatGPT's old training was the problem</li>
      <li>Expected <strong>early 2026 release</strong> as GPT-5.2 or 5.5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sam Altman's memo was brutal: "Delay advertising. Delay AI agents. Fix ChatGPT <em>now</em>." Why? Gemini app hit 650M monthly users (up from 450M). OpenAI needed $20B ARR by year-end. They were bleeding users.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Model</th>
          <th>Company</th>

          <td>Gemini 3</td>
          <td>Google</td>
          <td>Mobile/Reasoning</td>
          <td>Nov 2025</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Garlic</td>
          <td>OpenAI</td>

          <td>Q1 2026</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Opus 4.5</td>
          <td>Anthropic</td>
          <td>Safety/Math</td>
          <td>Dec 2025</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>For casual users: <strong>expect better coding help</strong> from ChatGPT soon. Garlic targets developers, but that means smarter explanations for everyone. Imagine asking "fix my Excel formula" and getting perfect code instantly.</p>

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>OpenAI blinked first. Google's momentum forced their hand. Garlic isn't just a model - it's proof the AI race is now a <em>sprint</em>.</p>
    <p>Watch for GPT-5.2 early next year. If the leaks are right, it'll feel like ChatGPT got a brain transplant.</p>
