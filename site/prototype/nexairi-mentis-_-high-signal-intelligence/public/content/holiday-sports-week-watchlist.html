      <h2>NFL Thanksgiving: The Traditional Slate</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>12:30 PM ET: Lions vs. Bears</strong><br>Detroit is chasing the #1 seed in the NFC, while Chicago’s young offense is fighting for a Wild Card spot. Expect high scoring and divisional grit.</li>
        <li><strong>4:30 PM ET: Cowboys vs. Giants</strong><br>A classic NFC East rivalry. Dallas needs this win to stay relevant in the division race.</li>
        <li><strong>8:20 PM ET: Dolphins vs. Packers</strong><br>The nightcap features two of the league's most explosive offenses in a potential Super Bowl preview. Speed in the cold at Lambeau.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Black Friday Football</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3:00 PM ET: Jets vs. Raiders</strong><br>Amazon’s exclusive Black Friday game. A grimy, defensive battle perfect for post-shopping recovery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>College Football: Rivalry Week (The Ones That Count)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Game: Michigan vs. Ohio State (Saturday, Noon ET)</strong><br>As always, likely deciding the Big Ten East and a CFP berth. The intensity here is unrivaled.</li>
        <li><strong>The Iron Bowl: Alabama vs. Auburn (Saturday, 3:30 PM ET)</strong><br>Even if records are lopsided, weird things happen at Jordan-Hare. A must-watch for chaos lovers.</li>
        <li><strong>Florida vs. Florida State (Saturday Night)</strong><br>A sunshine state battle with major recruiting implications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>NBA: Early Form Checks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thanksgiving Eve: Lakers vs. Warriors</strong><br>LeBron vs. Curry. The league always schedules this heavy hitter before the holiday break. A litmus test for the West.</li>
        <li><strong>Celtics vs. Bucks</strong><br>Eastern Conference supremacy on the line. Watch for defensive adjustments in the fourth quarter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to watch sanely with family</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick two priority windows; announce early and stick to them.</li>
        <li>Second‑screen quietly with captions; keep volume reasonable.</li>
        <li>Make it social: prop cards, squares, or a simple bingo keeps casual viewers engaged.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Setup checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet stable (reboot router day‑before), streaming logins verified.</li>
        <li>Spare HDMI cable, remote batteries, captions on by default.</li>
        <li>Soft throw on every seat—comfort keeps viewers happy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Enjoy the games—and the company. The wins are sweeter when the room’s happy too.</p>
