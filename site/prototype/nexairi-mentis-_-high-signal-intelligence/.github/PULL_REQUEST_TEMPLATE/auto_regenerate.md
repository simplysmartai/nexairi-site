This PR was opened automatically by CI to update the generated `public/posts.json` file after content changes or scheduled regeneration.

What this PR contains

Review checklist for maintainers
- [ ] Confirm the changes are limited to `public/posts.json` and expected metadata updates.
- [ ] Use the deploy-preview (Cloudflare/Netlify) to visually spot-check article listings and cards.
- [ ] If everything looks correct, add the `automerge` label to allow CI to merge this PR automatically.

If you find unexpected content changes, request changes on this PR and run `npm run update-posts-index` locally to reproduce and test.

Note about auto-merge
- Adding the `automerge` label will instruct CI to automatically merge this PR once all status checks pass. Use this only for trusted, small metadata updates.
