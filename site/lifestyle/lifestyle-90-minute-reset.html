        <h2>Quick takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stack 20 minutes of daylight and mobility within 30 minutes of waking to anchor circadian rhythms per AASM guidance.</li>
          <li>Alternate 25-minute focus sprints with five-minute release drills to meet ACSM movement targets without feeling chained to a desk.</li>
          <li>Use a three-part plate (25 g protein / 40 g slow carbs / color-rich produce) at brunch to stabilize glucose through your second sprint window.</li>
          <li>Log an energy delta in Airtable daily so Luna + Eden can flag overwork patterns before burnout sets in.</li>
          <li>Reserve the last 10 minutes of the 90 for future proofing &mdash; schedule one social touch, one admin task, and one experiment.</li>

      <div class="nx-article__body">
        <section>
          <h2>Why 90 minutes works (and when to stretch it)</h2>
          <p>Circadian rhythm anchors lock in roughly 90-minute ultradian cycles, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine still recommends seven to nine hours of sleep for adults. The 90-minute reset mirrors that cadence so you can warm up, fuel up, and focus without sacrificing the remainder of the day for deep work or calls.</p>
          <p>If you wake later, tack the block right after hydration and sunlight exposure. Early chronotypes can push to mid-morning to avoid trampling REM-heavy sleep. The one non-negotiable: the block starts only after five full minutes of daylight exposure. Window light counts, but balcony light is better. That signal hits the suprachiasmatic nucleus (your body's master clock) so cortisol rises gently rather than spiking.</p>
          <p>Even in winter, 1,000 lux of light by a window is achievable with a 10,000-lux lamp positioned 16-24 inches away. Record how alert you feel 15 minutes later and note it inside your tracker to see whether the timing sticks.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Mobility + breath circuit (minutes 0-20)</h2>
          <p>The reset starts with movement, not email. ACSM's guidance of 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly sounds hefty until you realize 20 minutes daily already covers two thirds. Follow this ladder:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hydrate with 350-500 ml of room-temperature water plus a pinch of mineral salt to replenish electrolytes.</li>
            <li>Complete four rounds of 4-2-4-2 box breathing to ease into parasympathetic mode.</li>
            <li>Mobility ladder (12 minutes): cat-cow x10, thoracic rotations x10 per side, 60 seconds of world's greatest stretch alternating legs, then 90-second ankle and wrist CARs to prep joints.</li>
            <li>Tempo march: jump rope, march in place, or a light jog for five minutes to reach roughly 60% max heart rate. Stop when you feel warm, not exhausted.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Log any discomfort inside Airtable or Notion. Vera, our fact checker, suggests tagging recurring pain so we can recommend a posture tweak or refer you to a licensed pro.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Light therapy, planning, and environment (minutes 20-40)</h2>
          <p>Anchor your senses next. Move to the brightest corner of your space or step outside. Aim for 10 minutes of direct daylight or 15 minutes beside a bright window paired with light therapy if you live above 40&deg; latitude in winter.</p>
          <p>While light does its work, skim your three priorities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Priority stack.</strong> One revenue move, one relationship move, one maintenance task.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Kanban check.</strong> Five-minute review to unblock collaborators.</li>
            <li><strong>Workspace sweep.</strong> Wipe the desk, refill water, open ventilation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Iris (brand designer) pushes for "micro-resets": align monitor height with your eyes, set color temperature to 5,000-6,500 K during daylight tasks and 2,700 K after sunset. WELL Building Standard research shows trimming glare and blue light in the evening can pull melatonin release up to 45 minutes earlier.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Fuel and supplement stack (minutes 40-55)</h2>
          <p>Breakfast or brunch? Opt for a 25/40/35 macro split: 25 grams protein, 40 grams low-glycemic carbs (steel-cut oats, quinoa, sprouted bread), and 35 grams of fiber-rich produce plus healthy fats. This plate delivers roughly 20-25% of daily fiber intake (USDA recommends 25 g for women, 38 g for men) and stabilizes glucose for about three hours.</p>
          <p>Sample plate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protein: two eggs plus 80 g smoked salmon (about 24 g protein).</li>
            <li>Carbs: half-cup cooked quinoa with cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Produce: sauteed spinach, cherry tomatoes, half an avocado.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Add-ons: vitamin D3 (especially October-March), 1,000 mg omega-3 if you skip fatty fish, and magnesium glycinate at night for muscle recovery. Cross-check supplements with a licensed provider. Track how you feel 30 and 90 minutes post meal &mdash; note digestion, focus, and mood so Milo can map copy to real results.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Focus sprints and release drills (minutes 55-85)</h2>
          <p>Now for the work block: two 12-minute sprints separated by micro-breaks, then a 10-minute admin wrap.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sprint 1 (12 minutes).</strong> Pick the highest-leverage task &mdash; drafting hooks, editing a reel, writing client emails. Brown-noise playlists help if your apartment is noisy.</li>
            <li><strong>Release 1 (3 minutes).</strong> Stand, roll shoulders, perform 10 air squats or wall angels.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint 2 (12 minutes).</strong> Shift to a complementary task (outline, organize files, prototype). Keep the same doc up to avoid context switching.</li>
            <li><strong>Release 2 (3 minutes).</strong> Vision break by focusing on a point 20 feet away for 20 seconds to relax eye muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint 3 (10 minutes).</strong> Admin pass &mdash; update CRM, send invoices, schedule posts &mdash; then two-minute journaling ("What restored me?" "What still feels sticky?").</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Future-proof close (minutes 85-90)</h2>
          <p>Use the final five minutes to guarantee the routine sticks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Schedule one 10-minute social touch (DM a collaborator, voice memo a friend).</li>
            <li>Book your next body-maintenance block (stretch session, PT, therapy).</li>
            <li>Jot one experiment you'll run today (new CTA, pricing tweak, creative format).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Rate your energy one to five and log it. Over 30 days, look for deltas. If the average dips below three for three days straight, add an extra rest block or shift bedtime earlier. Helix (ad ops) also wants to know when your energy is low so campaign promises stay realistic.</p>
